Many approaches coexist to discretize and solve optimal control problems (OCPs). In sports biomechanics, joint angle-driven algorithms are commonly implemented in which the joint angle time histories are approximated by series of quintic polynomial functions [REF Yeadon, Begon] or quartic splines [REF Leboeuf, Huchez, Mowmbaur, McPhee, Opensim]. 
Whereas evolutionary algorithms 
The number of papers about optimal control or dynamic optimisation is growing in robotics and biomechanics (Fig. X), probably because of increasing computer power but also the emergence of advanced open source (and proprietary) librairies for algorithmic differentiation and NLP solvers. 
Tools dedicated to OCP in biomechanics are rare. As shown by the recently launched MOCO, four interrelated components are required: \textit{i)} musculoskeletal modeling software (multibody kinematics and dynamics, muscle dynamics, etc.), \textit{ii)} a method for automatic differentiation, \textit{iii) a discretization approach, and \textit{iv)} a nonlinear programming (NLP) solver. Generic optimal control s}oftware (e.g. GPOPS-II [ref], Muscod-II [ref], Acado [ref]) provides solutions for component \textit{ii} to \textit{iv} but xxx. Since biomechanics is a community of software users [REFS], we believe that dedicated optimal control software will request a graphic user interface or at least a complete interface with a open source high-level language (e.g. Python) with a low-level core (C++) for efficiency. 

When developing such software, we should consider that human movements are often multi-staged (i.e. with different dynamics due to change in contact forces), [trouver d’autres], and models should be personalized, which may require several trials and parameter identification (e.g. isometric forces, mass properties of segments, etc.). 
Moreover, in contrast to the inverse flow which relies on measures, solving the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of motion may result in unanticipated behaviours, ranging from non-physiological joint angles or muscle patterns to singularities.

While CasADi is used in MOCO mainly for its interface to ipopt (ADOL-C being used for automatic differentiation),  this tool was first and foremost designed for algorithmic differentiation and is consequently widely used for solving NLP to reduce the cost and increase the accuracy of gradient and Hessian compared to finite-difference method. Acados, a recent NLP solver dedicated to DMS, was recently launched by the same research group as CasADi taking advantage of the algorithmic differentiation for real-time applications. Some applications, such as the real-time estimation of muscle forces, presently solved by inverse approach [REF] (from inverse dynamics to static optimization) or hybrid approach like the EMG-assisted algorithm in CEINMS [REF], become possible [citer article François-Amedeo].
