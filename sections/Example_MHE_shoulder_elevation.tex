This example is presented to introduce \bioptim's ability to provide real-time estimation of biomechanical variables.
The goal was to perform a real-time estimation of dynamically consistent joint kinematics and muscle forces, using a moving horizon estimation (MHE) approach (i.e. an optimization approach that uses a series of measurements observed over time). 
A shoulder elevation motion was performed with a 4-DoFs ($\bf{q}$) arm actuated by 19 Hill-type muscle elements.
The control inputs of the model were the muscle activations ($\bf{a}$).
The MHE implementation consists in splitting the OCP into a succession of smaller one for processing fixed-size subsets of the tracking data moving forward in time. 
Each time one subproblem is solved, a new measurement is added, the oldest one is discarded and a new subproblem is defined. 
Due to their similarities, the solution of the previous OCP is a good initial guess to the new one. 
The dynamical consistency of the final solution is enforced by continuity constraints on the initial state. 
Each objective function (Eq.~\ref{eq:ocp_exMHE}) was written as the sum of three terms: tracking reference joint angles ($\bf{q^*}$), states and muscle activations regularizations (i.e., least-square criteria):

In this example, reference data of an $8~s$ series of four arm elevations were generated at 100~Hz, by computer simulation.
A centered Gaussian noise (mean = 0, std = $0.005\:q^*(t)$) was added to $q^*$, to simulate experimental-like joints angle measurements.
Using a windows size of 7 nodes (i.e., \hl{XXX} ms), the estimator ran at about 33~Hz (one in three reference data frame was sent to the estimator to simulate experimental-like conditions), i.e., two and half times faster than standard biofeedback (13~Hz, \cite{kannape2013biofeedback}).
The MHE was able to forecast the movement kinematics with a root mean square error of $1.3\pm0.5\text{~}^{\circ}$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:joint_angles_MHE}) and to provide a realistic estimation of muscle forces close to the ground truth with a root mean square error of $10.6\pm13.6\text{~}N$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:muscle_forces_MHE}).
