The goal was to maximize the twist rotation ($\phi$) in a backward somersault.
The model is composed of a 6-DoF root segment and two 1-DoF torque actuated arms.
The OCP was solved for two models.
First, rotations of the root segment were expressed as Euler angles.
They were expressed as a quaternion for the second model.
The objective functions were written as follow:

\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:ocp_Trampo}
\mathcal{J} = -\underbrace{\int_0^T \dot{\phi} dt}_{MINIMIZE\_TWIST}  +  1\times 10^{-6} \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{2}\int_0^T \tau_{i}^2 dt}_{MINIMIZE\_ TORQUE},
\end{eqnarray}
where T in the duration of the movement and $\tau_{i}$ is the torque control of the $i^{th}$ arm DoF.
The first term of the objective function (Eq.~\ref{eq:ocp_Trampo}) corresponds to maximizing the twist velocity and the second term is for control regularization.


The movement lasted for approximately 1 second and was discretized in 100 shooting nodes.
The solutions for both models were similar (Fig.~\ref{snapshots_quaternion_base_twisting_somersault}) highlighting the equivalence of the two rotation representations.
Euler angles have the advantage to be easily interpretable, but they suffer from the loss of a DoF at the gimbal lock.
The use of quaternion representation is advantageous for numerical stability when a joint is free to rotate on a wide three-dimensional range for motion.
