The goal was to estimate joint torques which are dynamically consistent during one gait cycle from the first heel strike to the end of the swing phase using a 3D one-leg torque driven model with 12 DoFs.  \\

The experimental joint angles $q_m$ (obtained from markers using an extended Kalman filter), ground reaction forces $F_m$ and moments $M_m$ were tracked:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ocp_q}
\mathcal{J} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_i}\Bigg(\underbrace{\omega_1(\|q_p - q_m\|^{2})}_{TRACK\_STATE}
\label{eq:ocp_forces}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
+ \underbrace{\omega_2(\|\sum_{c=1}^{N_c}F_c - F_m\|^{2})}_{TRACK\_FORCES}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ocp_moments}
+ \underbrace{\omega_3(\|\sum_{c=1}^{N_c}OC\times F_c - M_{m,O}\|^{2})}_{TRACK\_MOMENTS}\bigg) 
\end{eqnarray}

where $N_i$ and $N_c$ are the number of time frames and contact points, respectively. 

The interaction between the ground and the foot was modelled using a 4-contact point model located at the heel and the forefoot (first and fifth metatarsi and toes - digit of the second toe). The stance phase was divided in three to follow the natural rolling movement of the foot from heel strike to toe off: heel, flatfoot and forefoot contacts. A constraint of non-slipping (NON\_SLIPPING) and unilateral contact force (CONTACT\_FORCE) were added for each stance phase. The use of the IMPACT state transition allowed to represent the gain of contact from a system without any contact (swing phase) to a system with contacts (heel strike) [ref thesis Felis - articles?].  


Based on force plateform data and markers position, each phase had a definite time inducing a complete simulation time of 0.93 s and was discretized in 94 intervals. The solution was able to reproduce a complete gait cycle [value RMSE - better with 3 contact points?] (Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots_multiphase_walking_cycle}).
