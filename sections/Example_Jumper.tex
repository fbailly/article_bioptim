This example is presented to introduce \textit{bioptim}'s ability to \hl{XXX}.
The goal was to find a minimal-time push-off phase for a \hl{XXX-DoF torque-driven} model while maximizing its jump height ($h$).
The push-off (impulsion before take-off) was divided into two phases with the following properties: \textit{1)} two contact points (heel and toe), duration $\in [0.2, 1.0]s$ and \textit{2)} one contact (toe), duration $\in [0.05, 1.0]s$.
The joint actuators bounds were modeled using a custom nonlinear constraint to account for torque/angle/angular-velocity relationships using the \verb?gauss3p? function of \textit{biorbd} \comment{based on predetermined factors}{je ne comprends pas} (\ref{fig:graph_force_vitesse_longueur}).
For each phase, the objective function was formulated as follow:

\[
\mathcal{J} = XXX.
\addtag
\label{eq:cost_jumper}
\]

The first term of Eq.~\ref{eq:cost_jumper} corresponds to maximizing the jump height.
The second term of the objective function serves for finding a minimal-time solution.

Using \textit{ipopt}, the problem was first approximately solved using the BFGS hessian approximation for 200 iterations maximum.
Then, \comment{if this maximum number of iterations was reached}{ne parler que de la solution présentée. Est-ce que le max_iter a effectivement été atteint ?}, the solution was re-optimized, using a warm-start, with exact-hessian computations for up to 1000 iterations .

The optimized ump height was 1,35m in \hl{XXX}s.
\comment{The used strategy is XXX with a proximo-distal shift of the joints (hip, knee then ankle) highlighted by the activation of the hip, then the knee and finally the ankle.}{à terminer}
